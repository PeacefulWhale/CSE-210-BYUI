# Jumper

This is just a "hangman" game but we're not hanging someone... We're just cutting their parachute until they fall and die? But it's okay, because we aren't the ones killing them, it's gravity that kills them... ~~even though it's gravity that kills them in a normal hangman game too~~.

I've got a word list that I found online, but I'm too lazy to serialize it into the compile end file, so I implemented a "backup" word list in case it can't load the file.

The word list has a lot of weird words, because it's the Scrabble (tm) word list (at least I think so).
