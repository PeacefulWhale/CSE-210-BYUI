# Tic Tac Toe

This is a very simple console application for a Tic Tac Toe game.

It supports many players, very large board sizes, and utilizes different colors for each player.

It is very simple and I doubt it's an optimal implementation of anything, sorry ;_;

## TODO

Maybe implement raylib, or support clicking on squares with the mouse?

Add options to play against the computer?

Maybe watch computers play against each other?
